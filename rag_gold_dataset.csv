"How can OpenAI's Realtime API be used to build a multi-lingual, one-way translation workflow using WebSockets?",vector,False,0.5,"# Translation Demo

This project demonstrates how to use the [OpenAI Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime) to build a one-way translation application with WebSockets. It is implemented using the [Realtime + Websockets integration](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-websocket). A real-world use case for this demo is multilingual, conversational translationâ€”where a speaker talks into the speaker app and listeners hear translations in their selected native languages via the listener app. Imagine a conference room with multiple participants with headphones, listening live to a speaker in their own languages. Due to the current turn-based nature of audio models, the speaker must pause briefly to allow the model to process and translate speech. However, as models become faster and more efficient, this latency will decrease significantly and the translation will become more seamless.

## How to Use

### Running the Application

1. **Set up the OpenAI API:**

   - If you're new to the OpenAI API, [sign up for an account](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
   - Follow the [Quickstart](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) to retrieve your API key.

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Set your API key:**

   - Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add the following line:
     ```bash
     REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
     ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   Navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the Speaker & Listener Apps:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The speaker and listener apps will be available at:
   - [http://localhost:3000/speaker](http://localhost:3000/speaker)
   - [http://localhost",0.7615945041179657,4,"found the demo section of doc, and keywords match",True
